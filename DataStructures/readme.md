# Java Data Structures
## Overview
This project is based on data structures that are commonly used
in programming languages such as Java or C#. The data structures that I 
implemented are the ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashTable.
I used the "program to the interface principle"
utilizing generic data types and interface contracts.

## How to run my code:
* Have installed any Java JDK 8 - 24. 
* You can run my project from an IDE such
as IntelliJ.
* Place the Iter and Map packages
in your src folder.  
Which will give you
access to the Data Structures.
