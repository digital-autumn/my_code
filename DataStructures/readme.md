# Java Data Structures
## Overview
Data Structures that I have written based 
off of the ArrayList and LinkedList in Java.
I used the "program to the interface principle".
Using Generic data types and interface contracts.

## How to run my code:
* Install Java JDK 24 (I believe JDK 8 - 24 
 should work.)
* You can run my project from an IDE such
as Intellij.
* Place the Iter package
in your src folder. Which will give you
access to the Data Structures.
